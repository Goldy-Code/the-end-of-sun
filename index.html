          Scientists Figured Out How And When Our Sun Will Die, And It's Going

              What will our Sun look like after it dies? Scientists have made
              predictions about what the end will look like for our Solar
              System, and when that will happen. And humans won't be around to
              see the final act. Previously, astronomers thought it would turn
              into a planetary nebula – a luminous bubble of gas and dust –
              until evidence suggested it would have to be a fair bit more
              massive. An international team of astronomers flipped it again in
              2018 and found that a planetary nebula is indeed the most likely
              solar corpse.

              The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old – gauged on the age of
              other objects in the Solar System that formed around the same
              time. Based on observations of other stars, astronomers predict it
              will reach the end of its life in about another 10 billion years.
              There are other things that will happen along the way, of course.
              In about 5 billion years, the Sun is due to turn into a red giant.
              The core of the star will shrink, but its outer layers will expand
              out to the orbit of Mars, engulfing our planet in the process. If
              it's even still there.

              They're named planetary nebulae not because they actually have
              anything to do with planets, but because, when the first ones were
              discovered by William Herschel in the late 18th century, they were
              similar in appearance to planets through the telescopes of the
              time. Almost 30 years ago, astronomers noticed something peculiar:
              The brightest planetary nebulae in other galaxies all have about
              the same level of brightness. This means that, theoretically at
              least, by looking at the planetary nebulae in other galaxies,
              astronomers can calculate how far away they are.

              The data showed that this was correct, but the models contradicted
              it, which has been vexing scientists ever since the discovery was
              made. "Old, low mass stars should make much fainter planetary
              nebulae than young, more massive stars. This has become a source
              of conflict for the past 25 years," said Zijlstra "The data said
              you could get bright planetary nebulae from low mass stars like
              the Sun, the models said that was not possible, anything less than
              about twice the mass of the Sun would give a planetary nebula too
              faint to see."

          Expanding red giant stars swallow close-orbiting planets. In our solar
          system, the sun will engulf Mercury and Venus, and perhaps Earth as
          well.

              A red giant is a dying star in the final stages of stellar
              evolution. In about five billion years, our own sun will turn into
              a red giant, expand and engulf the inner planets — possibly even
              Earth.Most of the stars in the universe are main sequence stars —
              those that convert hydrogen into helium in their cores via nuclear
              fusion. Over the course of their "normal" lives, the outward
              pressure of fusion inside main sequence stars balances out the
              inward pressure of gravity. Once the core fusion stops, however,
              gravity takes over and begins compressing the star. "This raises
              the internal temperature of the star and ignites a shell of
              hydrogen burning around the inert core," Swinburne University of
              Technology in Australia wrote in a stellar evolution
              explainer(opens in new tab).

            <p class="dicription">
              "Meanwhile, the helium core continues to contract and increase in
              temperature, which leads to an increased energy generation rate in
              the hydrogen shell," the explainer continues. "This causes the
              star to expand enormously and increase in luminosity — the star
              becomes a red giant." Red giant stars bloat to 62 million to 620
              million miles in diameter (100 million to 1 billion kilometers) —
              100 to 1,000 times wider than our sun is today. Because these
              stars' energy is spread across such a large area, their surface
              temperatures are actually relatively cool, reaching only 4,000 to
              5,800 degrees Fahrenheit (2,200 to 3,200 degrees Celsius), a
              little over half as hot as the sun. This temperature change causes
              stars to shine in the redder part of the spectrum, leading to the
              name "red giant," though they are often more orangish in
              appearance.
